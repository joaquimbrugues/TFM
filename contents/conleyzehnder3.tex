\section{The Conley-Zehnder index}

As we said in the introduction, the ultimate goal of this chapter is defining a map
\[\begin{array}{rccc} \mu : & SP(n) & \longrightarrow & \con{Z} \end{array}\]
that allows us to classify the paths of symplectic matrices according to their rotation map.

\begin{deff} The positive (resp. negative) components of $Sp(\R^{2n},\Omega_0)$ are
\[Sp(2n)^{\pm} = \{A \in Sp(\R^{2n},\Omega_0) \ | \ \text{det}(A - \text{Id}) \gtrless 0 \} .\]
\end{deff}
